            <h2 id="the-race-to-space">“The Race to Space”</h2>
            <p>By the mid-1950s, the space race was fully underway. Both
            the United States and the Soviet Union were committed to
            launching the first artificial satellite, leveraging their
            ballistic missile technology developed during the nuclear
            arms race (Neufeld 1995). The stakes were high, as the
            country that would achieve this feat would gain a
            significant psychological advantage in the Cold War.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="media/images/korolyov.jpg" class="small"

            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Portrait of Sergei
            Korolev</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The two space programs approached this challenge with
            clearly distinct strategies. The Soviet space program, led
            by Sergei Korolev, chose a path of speed and secrecy
            (Andrews et. al, 2011). This allowed them to conceal any
            failures and protect their technological secrets. However,
            it also meant that their achievements and successes would be
            met with surprise and skepticism by the international
            community.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="media/images/eisenhower.jpg" class="small"
            alt="Portrait of President Dwight Eisenhower" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Portrait of President Dwight
            Eisenhower</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In contrast, the United States, under President Dwight
            Eisenhower, was hesitant to boldly pursue an artificial
            satellite program. Eisenhower was concerned about how other
            nations would perceive an American satellite passing over
            their airspace, fearing it could be viewed as a violation of
            sovereignty (Schefter, 1999). As a result, the US focused on
            developing the necessary launch capabilities, through the
            Jupiter-C Rocket, while waiting for international policy to
            catch up.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="media/images/jupiter_c_pad.jpg"

            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of a Jupiter-C rocket
            on its launch pad</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Soviets were working on a sophisticated
            satellite with multiple scientific instruments. However,
            they soon realized that the technological hurdles were too
            great, and their intelligence incorrectly suggested that the
            United States was close to launching their own satellite. In
            response, the Soviets pivoted to a simpler design, focusing
            on a smaller, radio-transmitting satellite (Cadbury, 2006).
            This pivot was successful, and on October 4th, 1957, the
            Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the world’s first
            artificial satellite. The iconic beeps echoed by Sputnik 1’s
            radio transmitters captivated the world, generating
            widespread fascination, while simultaneously igniting
            anxiety within the US government and public.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="media/images/sputnik.jpg"
            alt="Image of the Sputnik 1 Satellite" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of the Sputnik 1
            Satellite</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The successful launch of Sputnik 1 caught the United
            States off guard, prompting a sense of fear and urgency. In
            the aftermath of Sputnik’s launch, the United States’
            satellite development program underwent a rapid escalation,
            with timelines significantly accelerated to facilitate their
            response. Unfortunately, the US experienced a launch failure
            in December 1957, which was met with international ridicule.
            However, this setback prompted further investment in the
            space program, and on January 31st, 1958, the United States
            successfully launched Explorer 1 into orbit.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="media/images/explorer1.jpg"
            alt="Image of the Explorer 1 Satellite" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of the Explorer 1
            Satellite</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Explorer 1, developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion
            Laboratory, was a smaller but more capable satellite than
            Sputnik 1. Equipped with instruments to measure cosmic
            radiation, micrometeorite impacts, and the Earth’s radiation
            belts, Explorer 1 transmitted valuable telemetry back to
            Earth (NASA, n.d.). This achievement marked a crucial
            success in the US space program, demonstrating the country’s
            ability to design, build, and operate an advanced
            satellite.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The formation of NASA, which occurred around the same
            time, signaled a new era of cooperation and coordination in
            the US space program. As the space race continued to unfold,
            the United States was poised to make significant strides,
            driven by the determination to surpass the Soviet Union and
            establish itself as a leader in space exploration.</p>
